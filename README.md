## Projects

### [ETSA-QC](https://github.com/Xild076/ETSA--QC-)
A research project aiming to create a modular glass-box aspect-based sentiment analysis model with new, novel insights on sentiment calculus with derived mathematical equations describing sentiment shifts. Currently collecting data: https://etsa-survey.streamlit.app/; and writing a paper for publishing!

- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**: Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Data Analysis

---

### [ObjectiveNews](https://github.com/Xild076/ObjectiveNews)
A project aimed at making news more objective by leveraging AI-driven analysis tools. It provides an efficient, end-to-end platform that collects news articles, groups key points of interest, summarizes the information, performs rule-based objectification of the information, and finally calculates the reliability score of the data based on an updated database of source accuracy.

- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**: Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Rule-based Objectification

### [Thinking Without Thinking](https://github.com/Xild076/LSDAI)
A systemic agentic AI that utilizes Gemma 27B to simulate "thinking", including planning, criticizing, refining, responding, evaluating, and fixing queries to derive a more coherent output for LLMs.

- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**: LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Agentic AI

### [StockPred](https://github.com/Xild076/StockPred)
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using advanced machine learning models. It supports a new application of sequence-to-sequence models on stock analysis.

- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**: Time Series Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Transformers

---

### [LSDAI](https://github.com/Xild076/LSDAI)
A speech and diction analysis tool that utilizes multiple machine learning models to extract and analyze key insights from audio data.

- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**: Speech Processing, Audio Analysis, LLM Feedback
